I am a postdoc at the University of Sydney, where I work on the 
[GLINT](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/491/3/4180/5638873)
nulling interferometer instrument on the Subaru Telescope. GLINT uses integrated photonics technology 
to miniaturize what used to only be done with bulk optics, and our Australia-based GLINT gang is pushing the technology to ever greater 
science capabilities.

From 2020 to 2023 I was a postdoc in Jeff Chilcote's research lab at the University of Notre Dame,
where I was in charge of testing and upgrading components of the Gemini Planet
Imager instrument in preparation for installing it on the Gemini-North
telescope in Hawaii. The motivation of this upgrade is to survey for massive planets
with low initial starting entropies (i.e., cool planets), and thereby provide
additional constraints on the physics of planet formation.

Prior to that, I was a grad student in the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer
group at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. My thesis work focused
on the technical commissioning one mode of the interferometer---the vaunted
Fizeau mode---and reducing a Fizeau dataset to probe for low-mass companions
around a nearby star with the unique PSF ([Spalding et al. 2022 *AJ*](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ac3b5b)).

injected by my pipeline. **Right:** 22.7-m baselines (solid lines) and 8.4-m
baselines (dotted lines) which this observation swept out around the habitable
zone (green) of said star.

I also characterized another unique observing mode at the
LBT to do differential photometry by pointing the twin sub-telescopes
apart in a "wall-eyed" pointing configuration ([Spalding et al. 2018 *PASP*](https://doi.org/10.1088/1538-3873/aa97cb)). In the meantime I observed for various other
projects including the LEECH exoplanet direct imaging survey ([Stone et al. 2018, *AJ*](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aaec00)), and the HOSTS
survey of exozodiacal dust disks ([Ertel et al. 2020, *AJ*](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab7817)) to constrain the exozodiacal luminosity function
so as to inform future space-based exoplanet direct imaging missions.
