Astrobites.org has posted an article based on my interviews with first-generation college students, and others who have faced more adversity on their journey than is commonly known or talked about. Read the article [here](https://astrobites.org/2023/05/16/rise-of-the-first-gens/). My thanks go to the interviewees for sharing their experiences.
