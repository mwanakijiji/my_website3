We've put out an article in *Physics Today* about the story of nulling interferometry
to characterize the exozodiacal dust population. Read all about it [here](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4982).

The above photo of the Large Binocular Telescope backdropped by the Milky Way was taken by [Ryan Ketterer](https://ryanketterer.com/),
and Steve Ertel added in the cone of light on the right-hand side to illustrate the disk of zodiacal dust in our own solar system---
which in reality is outside the frame of this image.
