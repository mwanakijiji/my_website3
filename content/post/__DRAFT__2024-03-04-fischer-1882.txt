1882-3 expedition of the naturalist Gustav Fischer, who ventured inland from Pangai (in today's Tanzania)
skirted the Usambara mountains. [PLACEHOLDER TEXT; OVERLAY FISCHER MAP WITH MODERN FOR DESCRIPTION]

My mom and I have produced another translation of a pre-colonial venture into East Africa: the 1882-3 expedition of the naturalist Gustav Fischer, who ventured inland from Pangai (in today's Tanzania), skirted the Usambara mountains.

Fischer’s article begins by describing the logistics of setting up an expedition, including negotiations with porters. As he proceeds on his journey, he describes the various items used for bartering, tribute payments, and (in one case) blood money. Describes the varied flora, fauna, terrain, and geology of the landscapes he passes through, makes detailed descriptions of the weather, and describes the fertility (or lack thereof) of the land and his caravan’s ability to find provisions. 
Fischer’s route goes up the Pangani River, proceeds past the Usambara and Pare mountains, past Mount Kilimanjaro (whose snows he describes as seen from a distance) and Mount Meru, past Lake Natron, and north along the Nguruman hills. He reaches as far north as Lake Naivasha before turning back. He describes the hydrothermally active area south of the lake, with hot springs and steam vents. 
Stopover at what he calls ngare neirobi (but which is apparently not the location of present-day Nairobi) (DOES IT APPEAR ON THE MAP?) 

Makes mention of what are consistent with Lake Magadi and Lake Elementaita, though he did not see them firsthand.

(WHAT OTHER TRIBES ARE MENTIONED?)

He includes descriptions of tribes and headmen he encounters and their cultural, geographic, and adversarial relations with each other. He writes with particular detail about the Maasai, including descriptions of their huts and encampments, clothing, ornamentation, ethnic complexions, livestock, their diet and mores surrounding it, the divisions of roles between men and women, the different classes among Maasai men, and their beliefs in supernatural powers, their rites, and the rough concept of “Ngai.” 
Relates a number of anecdotes of his interactions with the Maasai, including a few bits of dialog as interpreted by a translator. Fischer provides secondhand descriptions of Maasai raids, and firsthand descriptions of two attempted attacks on his caravan by Maasai warriors. 

A few photographs appear in the text, and an appendix includes drawings and descriptions of ethnological artifacts.
