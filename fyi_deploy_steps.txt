[In the my_website repository, do]

hugo server -D

[Edit files, look at webpage on local.]

[When satisfied with the way the website looks, deploy it to the public repository]

bash deploy.sh

[... and that should be it! Note that it's not strictly necessary to commit and push to my_website repo. Note also that that last bash step uses a script to do the following:]

hugo -D -d ../mwanakijiji.github.io

[The public repository should have committed and pushed to git. But if not, cd to that public repository, and commit and push changes]

[... There is another way of doing this using the deploy_old.sh script in my_website repo, but is more finicky.]
